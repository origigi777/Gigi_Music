# GO_Music
The GO Music application is used as an alternative music player app for the Android platform,
during this period, there are still some android built-in player apps that mix the music files with other unwanted audio files such as recordings, ringtones, etc...
To that end, I created this app - for starters, it selects the contents of the device and concentrates the desired music files.
I then created an option to add database songs online to make it easy to back up the songs on your device and share them with other devices.


I created this Java Project with the aim to make it easier for Android users and give them a better music experience.
also, I want to enable other students or anyone who wants to improve their programming abilities to get another source of inspiration for their projects
and for self-training.
